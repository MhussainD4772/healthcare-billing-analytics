## 📊 **Database Schema**

The SQLite database is automatically created with the following structure:

| Table | Description | Key Fields |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| **`patients`** | Patient demographics and information | `patient_id`, `age`, `gender`, `insurance_type` |
| **`billing`** | Billing records and charges | `claim_id`, `amount`, `date`, `status` |
| **`departments`** | Hospital departments | `department_id`, `department_name` |
| **`services`** | Medical services provided | `service_id`, `service_name`, `base_cost` |

---

## 🔍 **Core SQL Analytics**

### **Revenue Analysis**
```sql
-- Department revenue performance
SELECT 
    department,
    SUM(amount) as total_revenue,
    COUNT(*) as total_claims,
    AVG(amount) as avg_claim_amount
FROM billing 
GROUP BY department 
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC;
```

### **Patient Demographics**
```sql
-- Age group analysis
SELECT 
    CASE 
        WHEN age < 18 THEN 'Under 18'
        WHEN age BETWEEN 18 AND 30 THEN '18-30'
        WHEN age BETWEEN 31 AND 50 THEN '31-50'
        WHEN age BETWEEN 51 AND 70 THEN '51-70'
        ELSE 'Over 70'
    END as age_group,
    COUNT(*) as patient_count,
    AVG(total_charges) as avg_charges
FROM patients 
GROUP BY age_group
ORDER BY patient_count DESC;
```

### **Performance Metrics**
```sql
-- Insurance claim success rates
SELECT 
    insurance_type,
    COUNT(*) as total_claims,
    SUM(CASE WHEN status = 'approved' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as approved_claims,
    ROUND(
        (SUM(CASE WHEN status = 'approved' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*)), 2
    ) as approval_rate
FROM billing b
JOIN patients p ON b.patient_id = p.patient_id
GROUP BY insurance_type
ORDER BY approval_rate DESC;
```
